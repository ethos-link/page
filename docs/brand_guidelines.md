# EthosLink – Brand & Positioning Blueprint

> **Purpose** Use this living document as the single source of truth for EthosLink’s narrative, product positioning, and visual identity. It should inform landing-page copy, sales decks, nurture emails, social posts, and PR. Reviato, our flagship platform, inherits these principles.

## 1. Brand Essence

| Element            | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brand Name**     | **EthosLink** – signals the connection between service-led businesses and the values (“ethos”) that shape memorable guest experiences.                                   |

## 4. Portfolio Architecture

| Layer              | Purpose                                                                                          | Examples / Notes                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EthosLink (Corp)** | Parent brand: credibility, thought leadership, partnership tone.                                 | Owns website, investor collateral, hiring, partner relationships.     |
| **Reviato (Flagship Product)** | Reputation intelligence platform focused on hospitality and service SMBs.                    | Landing page, product marketing, demos, case studies, feature emails. |
| **Service Offerings** | Optional managed services (onboarding boosts, response coaching, analytics workshops).            | Use EthosLink branding; reference Reviato as the toolkit we deploy.   |

All outward communications should clarify: *“EthosLink builds Reviato.”* Lead with EthosLink on corporate surfaces; spotlight Reviato when the conversation is product-specific.

---

## 5. Differentiators vs. Typical Vendors

| Differentiator          | EthosLink + Reviato                                                                                       | Typical Alternative                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Clarity of Insight**  | Plain-language summaries tie ratings to real-world fixes within minutes.                                  | Technical charts that require analysts.    |
| **Operator-Friendly UX** | Mobile-friendly, checklist-based workflows; no steep learning curve.                                      | Complex enterprise dashboards.             |
| **Complete Coverage**   | Reviews, surveys, and social mentions across mainstream and niche platforms in one workspace.             | Google-first monitoring, limited sources.  |
| **Action Automation**   | Suggested replies, routed tasks, invite campaigns, and social boosts built-in.                           | Manual exports or bolt-on integrations.    |
| **Transparent AI**      | Explainable models, logged changes, and open pricing create trust with owners and investors.             | “Black box” scores, hidden fees.           |

---

## 6. Priority Audiences & Needs

| Segment                                   | Pain Points                                  | What We Deliver                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Independent Restaurants & Cafés**       | Limited time, inconsistent reviews, narrow margins. | SMS/email invites, digestible shift reports, suggested responses to protect ratings. |
| **Boutique Hotels & B&Bs**                | Feedback scattered across OTAs; team misalignment. | Unified inbox, housekeeping/FOH benchmarks, revenue-linked insight summaries.      |
| **Wellness & Personal Services**          | Reliance on word-of-mouth; no marketing firepower. | Automated follow-ups, social-ready showcase cards, loyalty prompts.                |
| **Multi-Site Groups (5–50 locations)**    | Hard to compare venues, no audit trail.           | Location scorecards, task routing, change logs for franchise ops and owners.      |

Tone reminders: write to owners, GMs, and operations managers who self-identify as “not tech people.” Use everyday language, time savings, and staff morale gains before deep AI detail.

---

## 7. Message Ladder

1. **Promise** – “Stay ahead of guest expectations without losing your weekend.”
2. **Proof** – Unified feedback hub, weekly insight digests, automation that runs between shifts.
3. **Payoff** – Higher ratings, calmer teams, more repeat business.
4. **Personality** – Warm, steady, reassuring; more coach than hype machine.

| Product Flows        | Direct, instructional, short sentences.                                                           | “Pick the platforms you monitor. We’ll pull the rest.”                      |
| Email Digests        | Conversational, appreciative, highlight 1–2 actions.                                              | “Guests loved brunch. Prep extra pastries on Saturday and reply to Mia’s note.” |
| Support / Docs       | Empathetic, step-by-step, avoid jargon.                                                           | “Click ‘Send Test’—we’ll show how the invite looks before guests receive it.” |
| Sales Outreach       | Curious, consultative, grounded in outcomes.                                                      | “How are you tracking locations that fall below 4.2 stars today?”            |

Never use fear tactics or overpromise automation. Celebrate teamwork and practical wins.
